        <div>
          Armenia is a mountainous nation in West Asia, a former Soviet Republic, and was one of the first Christian nations, embracing Christianity in the fourth century. This rich cultural and natural environment makes it an exciting destination for a wide range of adventure, activity and walking holidays.

          There are many pagan sites to visit as well as UNESCO World Heritage-listed churches, which are – almost without exception – built in stunning locations. Surrounded by forests, perched on the top of dramatic gorges or silhouetted before snow-capped mountains, they draw us to magnificent open spaces filled with a huge variety of trees and wild flowers.

          On Armenia tours we see wonderful mountains, lakes and waterfalls in the countryside – and relish cooling breezes – while the cafés and restaurants of the country’s capital, Yerevan, are proof of an emerging economy.

          Mount Ararat towers majestically over the city, and beautiful scenery is plentiful.
